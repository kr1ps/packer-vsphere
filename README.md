## How to use this repo

### Pre-requesites 

Make sure you have [Packer](https://www.packer.io/downloads) Version 1.7.1 or later installed. If you don't know Packer, it's a single commandline binary which only needs to be on your `PATH`.

### Step 1: Adjust variables

Rename the file [variables.auto.pkrvars.hcl.sample](variables.auto.pkrvars.hcl.sample) to `variables.auto.pkrvars.hcl` and adjust the variables for your VMware vSphere environment. Some documentation on each variable is inside the sample file.
```bash
mv variables.auto.pkrvars.hcl.sample variables.auto.pkrvars.hcl
nano variables.auto.pkrvars.hcl
```

### Step 2: Init Packer

Init Packer by using the following command. (Spot the dot at the end of the command!)
```bash
packer init .
```

### Step 3: Build a VM Template

To build a VM template run one of the provided `build`-scripts.   
For example to build a Ubuntu Server 20.04 template run: 
```bash
./build-2004.sh
``` 

### Optional: Template default credentials

the default credentials after a successful build are   
Username: `test`   
Password: `test`  
    
If you would like to change the default ćredentials before a packer build, then you need to edit the following files: 

- **variables.auto.pkrvars.hcl**
- **user-data** (Line 13.14; Line 41)

To generate an encypted password for [user-data](./html/user-data) use the following command: 
```bash
openssl passwd -1
```
